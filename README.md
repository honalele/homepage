##### Introduction

- Founder of AquaAge Inc. 
- PhD student in Informatics at Nagoya University

My research interest is modeling personalized driving styles for autonomous driving. During my PhD course, I first model subjective risk levels for individuals, and I will implement a Human-in-the-Loop prototype for personalized data-driven control to combine learning based risk models with model predictive control. 
I am also the founder of AquaAge Inc. https://www.aquaage.org/
