#### Research Assistant, 2nd Year PhD student in Informatics at Nagoya University

I am interested in designing a Human-in-the-Loop framework for personalized autonomous driving. During PhD I will implement the prototype of data-driven control to combine driver model with model predictive control.

##### ”How to win the Nobel Prize” - Esaki Leo

1. Don't allow yourself to be trapped by your past experiences. Don't hold on your preconceived motion. If you allow yourself to get caught up in social conventions or circumstances, you will not notice the opportunity for a dramatic leap forward when it present itself. You should be a free spirit.

2. Don't allow yourself to become overly attached to any one authority in your field - the great professor, perhaps. By becoming closely involved with the great professor you risk losing sight of yourself and forfeiting the free spirit of youth. Although the great professor may be awarded the Nobel Prize, it is unlikely that subordinate researcher will ever receive it.

3. Don't hold on to what you don't need. The information-oriented society facilitates easy access to an enormous amount of information. The brain can be compared to a personal computer with an energy consumption of about 2o watts. Although the brain occupies only 2 percent of the total energy. In terms of memory capacity or computing speed, the human brain has not really changed much since ancient times. Therefore, we must constantly be inputting and deleting information, and we should save only truly vital and relevant information. 

4. Don't avoid confrontation. 自分の主義を貫くため、戦う事を避けてはいけない。

5. Don't forget your spirit of childhood curiosity. It is the most vital component of creativity. いつまでも初々しい感性と飽くなき好奇心を失ってはいけない。

これらを述べた江崎Leoさんはこういった。上記の５つは必要だが、充分条件ではない。その上に運とChanceも必要なんだ。
